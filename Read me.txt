I have provided two snapshots, one in offline mode and one in deployment.

For offline i have written code in such a manner it connects and saves
model into database and fetches data.

Idea here is admin , will be given credentials , and for user
publish button will not be visible.for super user he will check in 
admin page.

I have tried to do the same in online , but for database it is chargeable
so i have done only frontend for displaying responsive data in ui for production

Data base connection is not possible.So 

credentials are 
username - rohithkumar
password - rohithkumar

but credentials asks for two factor authenetication which mapped to my
gmail account , so for this it requires my entry. 

else, without two factor authenetication - 

credentials are 
username - ramu
password -  ramu@1234


so , check ui in production mode , but data will not be stored it will display static
page , but in folder i have sent I have established database connection and
data will be entered dynamically.Online link is only for ui
